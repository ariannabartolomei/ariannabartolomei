Hi, Iâ€™m @ariannabartolomei !
Iâ€™m a Physics student and recently I've worked at my thesis project on a new Aladin plug-in, for INFN Perugia and University of Camerino. The purpouse behind the algorithm 
I'm sharing with you is to extend functionality of the Aladin software, for a more efficient representation of the conditional and marginal probability 
distribution of a GW source all over the sky. 
This is a Python code, which exploits the SAMP Protocol in order to communicate with Aladin, the major and most utilized VO software to manipulate GW sky maps. 
Once the statistical functions get implemented, and at each click on the sky map, a Tkinter GUI pops with a graph representing them. 
I hope this sharing will be very helpful.
